# Zoom

This is a basic Python script that automatically joins a Zoom meeting so you don't have to.                       
If you're like me and take naps before your next class, you never have to worry again!            
Make the current changes on the script, then create a new task on Task Scheduler.         
Sit back, relax and don't oversleep!

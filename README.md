# Zoom

This is a basic Python script that automatically joins a Zoom meeting so you don't have to.                       
If you're like me and take naps before your next class, you never have to worry again!            
Make the current changes on the script, then create a new task on Task Scheduler.         
Sit back, relax and don't oversleep!
  
# AUTOMATE THIS PROCESS
1. Open Task Scheduler and selct "Create Task". Give it a name.
2. In the "Triggers" tab, select "New"
3. Add a time for this script to run(Maybe 3 minutes before Zoom call begins)
4. Select any interval. IE Weekly, every Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.
5. Click "Ok", then switch to the "Actions" tab and select "New"
6. By default it will be on Start a program, all you need to do is add the path of the .py file
